# Customer-Segmentation-Using-K-Means
This project demonstrates how to use unsupervised machine learning techniques — particularly **K-Means Clustering** — to segment customers based on various features such as age, income, and spending behavior.

## Project Files

- `Sourcecode.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all code for data analysis, visualization, and clustering.
- `customer_segmentation.csv`: Dataset containing demographic and spending data of customers.
- `Output_Screenshots.pdf`: Visual documentation of output graphs and clustering results.

## Key Visualizations & Outputs

- Gender Count
- Distribution of Age
- Distribution of Annual Income
- Distribution of Spending Frequency
- Distribution of Actual Spending
- Scatterplot for Clustering (2D and 3D)
- Elbow Method for Optimal Clusters

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn (for clustering)

## Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- K-Means Clustering Algorithm
- Elbow Method to find optimal number of clusters
- 2D and 3D Visualization of Customer Segments

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   
   `git clone https://github.com/AnkamSaiPrasad/customer-segmentation-kmeans.git
   cd customer-segmentation-kmeans`
   #### If the above command didn't work
   you can also do this by placing the `Sourcecode.ipynb` and `customer_segmentation.csv` in same folder.
   
3. Install required packages:
  
   `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter`
  
3. Launch the notebook:

   `jupyter notebook Sourcecode.ipynb`
  
4. Run each cell for better understanding.
