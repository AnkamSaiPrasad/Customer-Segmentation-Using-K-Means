# Customer-Segmentation-Using-K-Means
This project demonstrates how to use unsupervised machine learning techniques â€” particularly **K-Means Clustering** â€” to segment customers based on various features such as age, income, and spending behavior.

## Project Files

- `Sourcecode.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all code for data analysis, visualization, and clustering.
- `customer_segmentation.csv`: Dataset containing demographic and spending data of customers.
- `Output_Screenshots.pdf`: Visual documentation of output graphs and clustering results.

## Key Visualizations & Outputs

Included in `Output_Screenshots.pdf`:

- Gender Count
- Distribution of Age
- Distribution of Annual Income
- Distribution of Spending Frequency
- Distribution of Actual Spending
- Scatterplot for Clustering (2D and 3D)
- Elbow Method for Optimal Clusters

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn (for clustering)

## Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- K-Means Clustering Algorithm
- Elbow Method to find optimal number of clusters
- 2D and 3D Visualization of Customer Segments
